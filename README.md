# ka9q-web

A web interface for ka9q-radio by John Melton G0ORX


## How to build ka9q-web

### 1 - Build and install ka9q-radio

- `git clone https://github.com/ka9q/ka9q-radio.git`
- detailed instructions are here: https://github.com/ka9q/ka9q-radio/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md


### 2 - Install the prerequisites for the Onion framework: GnuTLS and libgcrypto

The Onion framework requires GnuTLS and libgcrypto to compute the SHA1 checksum required by WebSockets.
They can be installed as follows:

- on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) and Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat):
```
sudo apt install libgnutls28-dev libgcrypt20-dev
```

- on Debian Stable (12, bookworm)  and similar Linux distributions:
```
sudo apt install libgnutls28-dev libgcrypt-dev
```

- on RedHat, CentOS, Fedora and similar Linux distributions:
```
sudo dnf install gnutls-devel libgcrypt-devel
```


### 3 - Build and install the Onion framework

The Orion framework includes a lot of dependencies (like sqlite3, redis, etc) that are not needed just to run ka9q-web. The instructions below build the Onion framework with all the dependencies. See section 3A for instructions to build a lighter version of the Onion framework with only the few necessary dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion
cd onion
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Before going ahead with the next steps, do make sure that the output from 'cmake' contains the line:
> -- SSL support is compiled in.

If you don't see it, please review the instructions about the prerequisites for the Onion framework in the previous section.

```
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### 3A - Build and install a light version of the Onion framework

These commands are almost identical to the ones in the section above except that all the unused features of the Onion framework are disabled to limit the number of dependencies and other packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion
cd onion
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DONION_USE_PAM=false -DONION_USE_PNG=false -DONION_USE_JPEG=false -DONION_USE_XML2=false -DONION_USE_SYSTEMD=false -DONION_USE_SQLITE3=false -DONION_USE_REDIS=false -DONION_USE_GC=false -DONION_USE_TESTS=false -DONION_EXAMPLES=false -DONION_USE_BINDINGS_CPP=false ..
```

Before going ahead with the next steps, do make sure that the output from 'cmake' contains the line:
> -- SSL support is compiled in.

If you don't see it, please review the instructions about the prerequisites for the Onion framework in the previous section.

```
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### 4 - Build and install ka9q-web

- edit the first line of `Makefile` to point to the directory where you built ka9q-radio
- run:
```
make
sudo make install
sudo make install-config    (it will install rx888-web.conf in /etc/radio)
```


## How to run ka9q-web

1. make sure ka9q-radio is running using the configuration rx888-web:
```
sudo systemctl start radiod@rx888-web
systemctl status radiod@rx888-web
```
Address any problem with radiod before going to the next step

2. start ka9q-web
```
ka9q-web
```

Finally open a browser and connect locally to http://localhost:8081 , or from a remote browser to http://<your computer name/IP>:8081

If you want to be able to record audio in the browser, then you need to start `ka9q-web -t 8082` which sets 8082 as the TLS port. When you connect
the browser will tell you that it is an insecure connection, but you can just click through this. It uses the certificate/key pair found in
`ka9q.key` and `ka9q.crt`. These can be changed to any certificate that you want. The 8081 port is still available and will just redirect you
to the secure port.

NOTE: to start ka9q-web on a different ka9q-radio control address, the command line option is '-m', for instance:
```
ka9q-web -m hf.local
```
