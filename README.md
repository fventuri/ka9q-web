```

- on Debian Stable (12, bookworm)  and similar Linux distributions:
```
sudo apt install libgnutls28-dev libgcrypt-dev
```

- on RedHat, CentOS, Fedora and similar Linux distributions:
```
sudo dnf install gnutls-devel libgcrypt-devel
```


### 3 - Build and install the Onion framework

```
git clone https://github.com/davidmoreno/onion
cd onion
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Before going ahead with the next steps, do make sure that the output from 'cmake' contains the line:
> -- SSL support is compiled in.

If you don't see it, please review the instructions about the prerequisites for the Onion framework in the previous section.

```
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```


### 4 - Build and install ka9q-web

- edit the first line of `Makefile` to point to the directory where you built ka9q-radio
